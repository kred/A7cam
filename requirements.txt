# Python package requirements for StudioTether
# Install with: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use unpinned package names to allow installing the latest versions.
# For reproducible installs in CI, consider pinning versions or using a lock file.

flet
numpy
opencv-python-headless
Pillow
httpx
gphoto2
rawpy

# The python gphoto2 binding is required but may be provided by your OS or packaging system.
# If a PyPI package is available in your environment, add it (for example `gphoto2`).
# Otherwise install the system lib (libgphoto2) and Python bindings via your OS package manager.
# Example (macOS): brew install gphoto2

# Notes:
# - libgphoto2 (system library) is required to talk to cameras.
# - If you plan to run without a display (headless), use opencv-python-headless.
# - Pillow is optional but recommended for EXIF parsing.
# - To create a reproducible requirements file, run: python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
# - rawpy requires Python 3.13 or earlier.
