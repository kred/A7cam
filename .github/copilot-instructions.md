# Copilot Instructions (Repository)

Please read these files in order and follow them when interacting with this repository:

1. `advisor-instructions.md` (must-read): high-level advisor role, constraints, and response templates. This file defines the *advisor mode* behavior for responses (ask clarifying questions first, present 2–3 alternatives, avoid auto-generating large code unless explicitly requested).
2. `project-instructions.md`: project-specific context (entry points, conventions, how to run and debug, helpful tips).
